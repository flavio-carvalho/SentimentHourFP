# SentimentHourFP
## A frequent patterns study on sentiment analysis dataset

Users are continually using text-based social networks and messaging applications to express their sentiments throughout the day. Each post can be interpreted as an event with a message and a time-stamp associated with it. With these considerations, interesting information can be extracted with pattern mining techniques. A question that arises from such  techniques is: How strong are the correlations between the time of day and emotions? This work aims to analyze sentiment intensity variation in social network users. The objective is to evaluate if pattern mining techniques applied over events enriched with sentiment analysis metadata can be used to address such a question. The results show patterns with higher measures of quality between negative sentiments and the afternoon and late morning hours. These results also lead to the possibility of future work applied to health care and social market interventions.

Set of tables with sentiment data was obtained in the Chronist project folder: https://www.kaggle.com/cjroth/chronist/kernels .

## Sentimentos ao longo do dia: Estudo de Padrões Frequentes

Usuários estão continuamente usando redes sociais baseadas em texto e aplicativos de mensagens para expressar seus sentimentos ao longo do dia. Cada postagem pode ser interpretada como um evento contendo uma mensagem e um carimbo de data / hora associado a ela. Com essas considerações, informações interessantes podem ser extraídas com técnicas de mineração de padrões. Uma questão que surge de tais técnicas é: Quão fortes são as correlações entre a hora do dia e as emoções? Este trabalho tem como objetivo analisar a variação da intensidade de sentimento em usuários de redes sociais. O objetivo é avaliar se as técnicas de mineração de padrões aplicadas sobre eventos enriquecidos com metadados de análise de sentimento podem ser usadas para tratar de tal questão. Os resultados mostram padrões com medidas de qualidade mais altas entre os sentimentos negativos e as horas da tarde e do final da manhã. Esses resultados também apontam para a possibilidade de trabalhos futuros aplicados à saúde e intervenções no mercado social.

 Conjunto de tabelas com dados de sentimentos foi obtido na pasta do projeto Chronist: https://www.kaggle.com/cjroth/chronist/kernels .
